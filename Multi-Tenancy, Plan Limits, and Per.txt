Multi-Tenancy, Plan Limits, and Permissions (Employer Side)
1) Tenancy boundaries (non-negotiable)
Employer/Owner users must ONLY see data that belongs to their organization.
SuperAdmin can see everything across orgs, but employer views must always be:
•	org-scoped (only their organization)
•	location-scoped (only the selected location, or “All Locations” when allowed)
•	plan-scoped (respect subscription limits)
If the employer UI shows cities/locations not owned by that org, that means you are accidentally reusing a SuperAdmin/global dataset.
2) Plan limits to enforce (HURE Core)
Use these plan limits:
•	Essential: 1 location, 10 staff accounts, 2 admin seats
•	Professional: 2 locations, 30 staff accounts, 5 admin seats
•	Enterprise: 5 locations, 75 staff accounts, 10 admin seats
Important: “Admin seats” means number of users with elevated access, not the number of role templates.
3) Location scoping rules (Single vs Multi-location)
A) Essential (1 location)
UI expectations
•	Do NOT show a location dropdown.
•	Automatically scope all pages to the single locationId.
•	No “All Locations” option.
Data expectations
•	All lists (Staff, Schedule, Attendance, Leave, Docs) must query with:
o	organizationId = currentOrgId
o	locationId = the only locationId
B) Professional (2 locations)
UI expectations
•	Show location dropdown with:
o	All Locations
o	Location A
o	Location B
Data expectations
•	When “All Locations” selected:
o	show data for all org locations (but still within org)
•	When a specific location selected:
o	filter all module data by that locationId
C) Enterprise (5 locations)
Same behavior as Professional, but up to 5 locations in the dropdown.
4) Where location lists must come from (fixing your current issue)
On the Employer side, the location dropdown must be populated only from:
locations WHERE organization_id = current_org_id
Then enforce plan limit:
if count(locations) > plan.locationLimit
  show warning + block creation of new locations until upgrade
Do not pull from global master cities / SuperAdmin location tables.
5) Staff limit enforcement (per plan)
Enforce staff capacity at two levels:
UI level
•	Disable “Add Staff” when at limit
•	Show message:
“You’ve reached your plan limit (10/30/75). Upgrade to add more staff.”
Backend level (hard enforcement)
•	Reject add/create requests if staff count >= limit
Staff count should be computed as:
•	all active staff accounts under org (or per location if you choose)
•	recommended: org-wide staff cap (simpler + consistent with billing)
The Staff module already follows the intended employer workflow patterns in the demo 
HURE_Core_Employer-staff module
6) Permissions and why Employer must have it in navigation
I noticed Permissions was removed from the left navigation. Please restore it.
Why Employer needs Permissions access
Because in our model:
•	Employer defines roles and permissions (HR, Payroll, Shift Manager, etc.)
•	Employer assigns staff to those roles
•	SuperAdmin does not manage internal clinic permissions
If the employer cannot access Permissions, then:
•	they can’t tailor roles to clinic reality
•	you end up hardcoding roles (bad for different clinics)
•	support load increases (“please change access for X”)
•	it breaks our “employer autonomy” product promise
The Full dashboard demo includes a Permissions tab in the sidebar for employer roles 
7) The “Admin seats” rule (how permissions interact with plan limits)
We are not limiting role names. Employers can create:
•	HR
•	Payroll
•	Shift Manager
•	Operations
•	Compliance
…any labels they want.
But the system enforces capacity:
An “admin seat” is any user assigned a role that includes elevated permissions.
Elevated permissions (examples)
•	manage_staff
•	manage_schedule
•	approve_leave
•	edit_attendance
•	export_payroll
•	manage_docs_policies
•	manage_verification
•	manage_settings
Enforcement behavior
When assigning a role to a user:
•	If the role includes any elevated permissions → it consumes 1 admin seat.
•	If employer tries to assign a 6th elevated user on Professional:
o	block the assignment
o	show message:
“You’ve reached your plan’s admin access limit (5 users). Upgrade or change an existing admin to Employee.”
8) UI behavior summary (what the employer should experience)
•	Single-location clinics: no location switcher, everything just works.
•	Multi-location clinics: location switcher controls all modules.
•	Employers always see only their own org’s locations and staff.
•	Employers can manage Permissions because they are responsible for their internal operations.
•	System enforces subscription limits quietly (disable + explain).
Use a plan config like:
const PLAN_LIMITS = {
  ESSENTIAL: { locations: 1, staff: 10, adminSeats: 2 },
  PROFESSIONAL: { locations: 2, staff: 30, adminSeats: 5 },
  ENTERPRISE: { locations: 5, staff: 75, adminSeats: 10 },
};
Then enforce in:
•	Location creation
•	Staff creation
•	Role assignment to elevated roles
My additional request
Rename the Card
Pending Review (Verification) to Compliance Status
Show breakdown, not a single number.
Example:
•	Organization Verification → Pending / Approved
•	Facility Licenses → 1 Pending / 1 Approved
•	Staff Licenses → 2 Expiring Soon
Quick Actions 
This is one of the strongest and perfect sections. Just a small change in the order
Currently
•	Manage Staff
•	View Schedule
•	Attendance
•	Export Payroll
Suggested order
1.	View Schedule
2.	Manage Staff
3.	Attendance
4.	Export Payroll
This matches how clinics actually operate day-to-day.

Schedule section
I noticed the External coverage / External locum option was removed from the Schedule → Manage coverage flow.
Please add it back, as it is an intentional and necessary part of the Schedule module, not Payroll.
Reason:
In real clinic operations, a shift manager may be unable to find in-house staff and will source coverage externally (agency, CareStint, or personal network).
The system still needs to mark the shift as covered so coverage gaps are accurate.
Why this is required (real clinic workflow)
In real clinic operations, a shift manager may be unable to find in-house staff and will source coverage externally (agency, CareStint, or personal network).
The system must still:
•	Mark the shift as covered
•	Remove coverage gaps
•	Keep a record of who actually covered the shift
Scope clarification (very important)
External coverage is:
•	Coverage-only at the schedule block level
•	A non-employee record
•	Manually entered by the shift manager
External coverage is NOT:
•	Employment
•	An in-house staff member
•	Subject to staff/admin limits
•	Part of Attendance tracking
External coverage MUST NOT:
•	Create staff profiles
•	Appear in Staff module
•	Generate Attendance records
•	Be treated as Monthly Salary payroll
Expected Schedule behavior
•	External professional is added manually inside Manage Coverage
o	Name
o	Optional phone
o	Optional supervisor
o	Optional notes (agency / agreed pay)
•	Counts toward required headcount
•	Coverage status updates correctly
(e.g. “Short by 1” → “Covered”)
This logic belongs under Schedule → Coverage, not Payroll.
Payroll clarification (do NOT skip this)
While external coverage is not employment, it must still create a payroll-ready record for reporting and export purposes.
•	External coverage entries should appear in Payroll Export → Casual / Daily
•	As a separate register, not mixed with employee payroll
•	For audit, approval, and export only (as shown in the demo payroll)
This preserves:
•	Coverage accuracy
•	Financial accountability
•	Clean separation between employees and externals
Date format + time formatting 
In the table you have “25 Dec 2025” (good).
In the modal the placeholder is mm/dd/yyyy (US format), this will confuse Kenyan/TZ/Uganda users.
•	Use dd/mm/yyyy placeholder OR better: show date picker with label “Date (DD/MM/YYYY)”
•	Keep display format consistent everywhere (like “25 Dec 2025”).
Coverage summary card should “match” the table
Right now it shows:
•	“2 schedule blocks”
•	“4 gaps”
For clarity add:
•	“Total required headcount”
•	“Total assigned”
Example:
•	Blocks: 2
•	Required: 7
•	Assigned: 3
•	Gaps: 4
That makes the summary feel like it’s derived from the table.
Add two tiny filters (huge usability win)
Above the table, add:
•	Date range (This week / Next 7 days / This month / Custom)
•	Role filter (Nurse, CO, Lab Tech…)
Attendance
“Absent” logic is currently unreliable
In your screenshot, someone clocked in 05:59 and clocked out 06:09 but status shows absent.
I suggest
•	Present (Full)
Staff worked the full scheduled shift duration
(or ≥ 8 hours if no schedule exists)
•	Present (Partial)
Staff worked at least 1 hour but less than the full scheduled shift
•	Absent
No clock-in recorded or total time worked was less than 1 hour
•	Late
Clock-in time is after the scheduled shift start
(applies only when a schedule exists)
•	No Clock-out
Clock-in recorded but no clock-out recorded
So “05:59–06:09” becomes Present (Partial) or Short shift — not absent.
How it ties into Payroll
Casual / Daily-paid staff
•	Full shift → 1 unit
•	Partial present → 0.5 unit (or pro-rated later)
•	Absent → 0 units
Salaried staff
•	Attendance is informational:
o	flags patterns (late, partial, absent)
o	doesn’t auto-deduct unless HR decides
Payroll
Date format is wrong for your market
The picker shows:
•	12/02/2025 → 12/27/2025 (US format)

•	change to East African format
2 December 2025 → 27 December 2025
Delete the note at the bottom that says:
“Calculations based on KES 500/hour regular rate, 1.5x for overtime…”
Clinics pay monthly salary, daily rate, or hourly
Attendance → Payroll mapping is not visible
Make payroll derived, not “magic”
Add a small explanation panel above the table:
Payroll is calculated from reviewed attendance records within the selected date range.
Then list rules (short, human):
•	Full Day = Full shift worked
•	Half Day = Present (Partial)
•	Absent = No pay (unless salaried)
•	Overtime = Hours beyond scheduled shift
Split logic by pay type (critical)
You already support different pay types in Staff. Payroll must respect that.
 (simple + realistic)
For Salaried staff
•	Gross = Monthly salary
•	Attendance used for:
o	reporting
o	discipline
o	exceptions (later)
•	Do not auto-deduct yet
For Daily / Casual staff
•	Full day = 1 unit × daily rate
•	Half day = 0.5 unit × daily rate
•	Absent = 0
For Hourly staff (optional now)
•	Gross = hours × hourly rate
•	OT = hours beyond shift × OT multiplier
Do NOT apply one flat “KES 500/hour” logic to everyone.
Lock attendance before payroll
This is very important.
Add a requirement:
•	Payroll only includes attendance marked as “Reviewed / Locked”
•	If not locked:
o	Show warning:
“Some attendance records are not yet reviewed and will be excluded.”
See all the columns in the payroll section of the demo, they are very important to make the numbers instantly understandable, so I will appreciate if you can have them in the final product
Under the Casual/Daily section, the  records should be created from Schedule → External cover entries, and stored as a payroll-ready register:
•	date/period
•	role
•	location
•	external name + optional phone
•	optional supervisor + notes (agency / agreed pay)
•	units (Full=1, Half=0.5, Absent=0)
•	payroll status workflow: Draft → Submitted → Approved → Paid
Important constraints:
•	External cover records must NOT create staff profiles
•	External cover must NOT appear in Staff or Attendance
•	Payroll Export is for records/export, not full payroll processing.
Billing 
The section is perfect, please just add
A) Make Plan Limits actionable (very important)
Right now it says:
•	Locations: 2
•	Staff: 30
Instead, it should say something like:
Plan limits
•	Locations: 2 / 2 used
•	Staff: 27 / 30 used
•	Admin roles: 3 / unlimited (or hidden, depending on your decision)
And if exceeded:
•	Soft warning (yellow)
•	Not a hard block without messaging
This ties Billing → Staff → Locations → Permissions together cleanly.
Add “Upgrade / Manage plan” entry point
Even if it’s not functional yet, the UI needs:
“Manage subscription” or “Upgrade plan” button. You can gate it behind:
“Contact HURE to upgrade”
Expand Invoices (without making it complex)
Invoices should show:
•	Invoice number
•	Date
•	Amount
•	Status (Paid / Due / Overdue)
•	Download PDF
Add a short explainer 
•	Something like:
•	“Billing covers your HURE Core subscription and usage limits. Payroll payments to staff or external cover are managed separately.”
Verification
Replace Verification with Organization Details
Change the summary language
•	“Verification Summary” → Compliance Summary
•	“Facilities (6 locations)” should not hardcode 6.
Make it dynamic based on plan + created locations:
o	Facilities (X locations)
Important plan enforcement (multi-tenancy)
Facility Licensing list should only show locations the employer is allowed to have:
•	Essential: 1 location
•	Professional: 2 locations
•	Enterprise: up to 5 locations
If more exist in demo data, still display only allowed locations (or show locked ones with “Upgrade to add location”).
Missing actions
•	There is no Upload
•	There is no Submit
•	There is no Pending state behavior
•	There is no guidance text
Settings
Settings should allow:
•	Edit organization display name
•	View locations
•	Add new locations (if plan allows)
•	Edit basic location metadata:
o	Location name
o	City / town
o	Address
o	Phone number 
•	See location verification status (read-only)
