SINGLE-LOCATION CLINIC WORKFLOW
Step 1: Account creation
Clinic provides:
•	Organization name
•	Contact person name
•	Phone number
•	Email
•	Password
Account is created in PENDING_VERIFICATION
Step 2: Organization verification
User submits:
•	Business registration / incorporation certificate
•	(Optional but recommended) KRA PIN
Status options:
•	Pending
•	Under review
•	Approved
•	Rejected (with rejection notes) 
Notifications:
•	Status updates sent to Notifications section 
Allow plan purchase after organization verification
Do NOT require facility approval to purchase plan (too much friction)
Step 3: Facility verification (single location)
Since there is only one location:
•	Facility form should appear immediately (no dropdown)
•	Required:
o	Facility name
o	License number
o	Licensing body
o	License expiry date
o	Upload license document (PDF / image)
o	Submit
Status:
•	Pending
•	Approved
•	Rejected (with notes + notification)
What should be locked if facility is not verified:
•	Scheduling
•	Attendance
•	Payroll export
What should still work:
•	Settings
•	Profile
•	Verification
Step 5: Normal operations
Once facility is approved:
•	Everything unlocks
•	No extra steps
MULTI-LOCATION CLINIC WORKFLOW
Step 1: Account creation
Same as single clinic:
•	Org name
•	Contact person
•	Phone number
•	Email
•	Password
Step 2: Organization verification (ONCE)
User submits:
•	Business Registration Number
•	KRA PIN (Optional but recommended)
Status:
•	Organization = Approved
This unlocks ability to add locations
Allow plan purchase after organization verification
Step 3: Add locations 
User adds:
•	Nairobi
•	Kisumu
•	Mombasa
•	etc.
Each location starts as:
•	Draft / Not verified
Step 4: Facility verification (per location)
For each location, user must submit:
•	License number
•	Licensing body
•	Expiry date
•	Upload license document
Status per location:
•	Approved / Pending / Rejected
Step 5: Plan enforcement logic (VERY IMPORTANT)
Your plan limits should control:
•	How many locations can be ACTIVE
•	Not how many can exist as drafts
Example:
•	Professional plan = 2 locations
•	User can:
o	Add 5 locations
o	But only 2 can be active + operational
o	Others remain locked until:
	upgraded plan to Enterprise
	or deactivated location
